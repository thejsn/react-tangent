### `keys`

The keys array can either consist of strings or objects.
Use the `maxCols` prop to control number of keys per row when using strings.

#### Key strings

```
// A key is 4 cells be default, 
// this will result in 2 keys per row:

<Tangent maxCols={ 8 } keys={ 'qwerty'.split('') } />
```

#### Key objects

Key object has the following fields

| field | default | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| label | ''			| The text displayed in the key. |
| id 	| ''			| An identifier for the key. Is returned with onKeyPress callback. Can also be used to match key in css with `.tangent-key--[id]`. |
| x			| 0 | The keys' leftmost grid cell. |
| y			| 0 | The keys top grid cell. |
| width		| 4 | The number of grid cells a key occupies horizontally. |
| height	| 4 | The number of grid cells a key occupies vertically. |


```
// The beginning of a keyboard...

<Tangent keys={[
  {
    label: 'ยง',
    id: 'paragraph'
  }, {
    label: '1',
    id: '1',
    x: 4
  }, {
    label: '2',
    id: '2',
    x: 8
  }, {
    label: 'Tab',
    id: 'tab',
    y: 4,
    width: 6
  }, {
    label: 'Q',
    id: 'q',
    x: 6,
    y: 4
  }
]} />
```

### Key listeners

```
<Tangent 
  onKeyClick={ keyListener }
  onKeyPress={ keyListener }
  onKeyRelease={ keyListener }
  keys={ '12345'.split('') } />
```

```
keyListener(data) {
  // Will return id and label
  
  const { id, label } = data;
}
```
